## Pareto front

each point on the front represents a different trade-off between possibly conflicting objectives

- in the context of multi-objective optimization (= problems that have a set of optimal solutions; MOO)
- "MOO problems have a set of optimal solutions, the Pareto front, each reflecting a different trade-off
  between objectives. Points on the Pareto front can be viewed as an intersection of the front with a
  specific direction in loss space"

([Navon et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04104.pdf))

## Saddle point

point on the surface of the graph of a function where the slopes (derivatives) in orthogonal directions are all zero (a critical point), but which is not a local extremum of the function

- example: when there is a critical point with a relative minimum along one axial direction (between peaks) and at a relative maximum along the crossing axis
- the name derives from the fact that the prototypical example in two dimensions is a surface that curves up in one direction, and curves down in a different direction
